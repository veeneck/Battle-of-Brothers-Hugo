body: 'Estimating cost is easy IF you have a firm grasp on what you need and how you will need it. 

For characters, having clear concepts to work of is key- a vague concept will allow for a lot of variety in result, whereas a precise concept will ensure more uniform results.

as for actual rates/costs they do vary, especially when comparing veteran art developers to junior or entry level- the trade off is that the more veteran candidates HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE (usually many time) and so are much more likely to provide you assets effectively, quickly and consistently.

I am one of those veterans- Let me know if you are interested in talking further.  I&#39;ll send you my info through your contact page.

Kevin.'
