body: 'My developer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP.
I have always disliked the idea because of the expenses. But he&#39;s tryiong none 
the less. I&#39;ve been using Movable-type on several websites for about a year and am anxious about switching to another platform.
I have heard fantastic things about blogengine.net. Is there a way I can import all my wordpress posts into it?
Any kind of help would be really appreciated!'
