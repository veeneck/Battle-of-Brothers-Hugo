body: 'You should keep a cache of items so you can remove them via key/value this is what I do with over 2k objects and only use about 2% cpu resources while swapping in/out all the time. 

Granted I use sprite sheets so the reload of images, sprites etc. is no drastic hit because the actual image is already loaded into openGL.

I think you will find it will make your life easier by keeping a cache and if you are like me I keep a json cache so i can add stuff like &quot;destroyed&quot; : true, &quot;currentstate&quot; : 1, etc. and so forth.

It allows me to expand the object out in real time without having to reload anything.'
