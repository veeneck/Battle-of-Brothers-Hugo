Yeah, I use TexturePacker and I can&#39;t imagine trying to create sprite sheets without it. It&#39;s still a tedious process, though =) 

The UI is definitely a placeholder, but I&#39;m all ears if you have any suggestions as to styles styles or games that you like for a turn based type of games.'
