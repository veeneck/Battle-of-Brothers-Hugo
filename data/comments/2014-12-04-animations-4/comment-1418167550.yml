body: 'Cody, I&#39;m working with an animator who uses Maya to create the 3d models and animations. I&#39;m not sure exactly what is involved on his end, but he sends me .png files that I can use to build sprite sheets. From what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s not too uncommon (http://www.studica.com/blog/exporting-3d-models-as-2d-sprites).
