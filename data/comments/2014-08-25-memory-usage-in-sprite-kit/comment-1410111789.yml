body: 'Thanks for the comments -- it&#39;s great to hear when people enjoy the site / info. Right now, everything I do is for documentation. It will be neat to look back at the past year+ when this is finished. Also, I haven&#39;t found any consolidated info that sets real expectations for indies, so hoefully we&#39;ll have a wealth of knowledge to share at the end. I can already tell this process is / will continue to be much harder than I expected. Putting myself out there isn&#39;t much of an issue because in my experience, most devs struggle with similar things at some point in time. It&#39;s more about learning, and getting things done. The smartest guy in the room isn&#39;t always the best project lead. 

If you have any specific questions, you can reach me on twitter, or through the contact from (link at top of page).'
