body: "EmploymentThe genre is not well-defined but might include propaganda works of early Soviet parliamentarians like Dziga Vertov, present-day filmmakers including Chris Marker,<>3] Michael Moore (Roger & Me (1989), Bowling for Columbine (2002) and Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004)), Errol Morris (The Thin Blue Line (1988)), Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me: A Film of Epic Portions) and AgnГЁs Varda. Jean-Luc Godard describes his recent work as \"film-essays\".<>4] Two filmmakers whose work was the antecedent to the cinematic essay include Georges MГ©liГЁs and Bertolt Brecht. MГ©liГЁs made a short film (The Coronation of Edward VII (1902)) about the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII, which mixes actual footage with shots of a recreation of the event. Brecht was a playwright who experimented with film and incorporated film projections into some of his plays.<>2] Orson Welles made an essay film in his own pioneering style, released in 1974, called F for Fake, which dealt specifically with art forger Elmyr de Hory and with the themes of deception, \"fakery,\" and authenticity in general. These are often published online on video hosting services.<>5]<>6]Huxley adds that the most satisfying essays \"...make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.\"ExemplificationA film essay (or \"cinematic essay\") consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay.<citation>needed] From another perspective, an essay film could be defined as a documentary film visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends documentary, fiction, and experimental film making using tones and editing styles.<>2]FamiliarAs with the novel, essays existed in Japan several centuries before they developed in Europe with a genre of essays known as zuihitsu вЂ” loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese literature are in this genre. Notable examples include The Pillow Book (c. 1000), by court lady Sei ShЕЌnagon, and Tsurezuregusa (1330), by particularly renowned Japanese Buddhist monk Yoshida KenkЕЌ. KenkЕЌ described his short writings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as \"nonsensical thoughts\" written in \"idle hours\". Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that women have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.AcademicIn the visual arts, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work's composition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes from the word essay's meaning of \"attempt\" or \"trial\").The defining features of a \"cause and effect\" essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the subject, determine the purpose, consider the audience, think critically about different causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the language, and decide on a conclusion.<>]English essayists included Robert Burton (1577вЂ“1641) and Sir Thomas Browne (1605вЂ“1682). In France, Michel de Montaigne's three volume Essais in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay. In Italy, Baldassare Castiglione wrote about courtly manners in his essay Il Cortigiano. In the 17th century, the Jesuit Baltasar GraciГЎn wrote about the theme of wisdom.<>] During the Age of Enlightenment, essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of periodical literature, as seen in the works of Joseph Addison, Richard Steele and Samuel Johnson. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English вЂ“ William Hazlitt, Charles Lamb, Leigh Hunt and Thomas de Quincey all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects. In the 20th century, a number of essayists tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g., T.S. Eliot). Whereas some essayists used essays for strident political themes, Robert Louis Stevenson and Willa Cather wrote lighter essays. Virginia Woolf, Edmund Wilson, and Charles du Bos wrote literary criticism essays.<>] \r\n \r\n<a href=http://agropromnika.dp.ua/component/users/?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=user&id=89309>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://www.drdhbubbles.com/users/5c26edd656b5d200049dc2c2>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.iklanbarisposkota.net/author/essay-writing-service/>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://gamecenter.idknet.com/forum/member.php?u=214410>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=https://btcoinz.com/forum/profile.php?id=59285>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://icedepth.com/forum/profile.php?id=44317>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://motoproduct.ru/forum/member.php?2701-Essay-Writing-Service>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://mjtdrgharib.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=user&id=73990>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://hakteam.com/member.php?u=21>essay writing service</a>\r\n<a href=http://forum.mir.dn.ua/index.php?showuser=1622107>essay writing service</a>\r\n \r\n \r\nUniversity students, like these students doing research at a university library, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they have read.DescriptiveAn essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a \"prose composition with a focused subject of discussion\" or a \"long, systematic discourse\".<>] It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. Aldous Huxley, a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject.<>] He notes that \"the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything\", and adds that \"by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece\". Furthermore, Huxley argues that \"essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference\". These three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:DialecticMalthus' Essay on the Principle of PopulationHistory (thesis)An exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable examples including anecdotes. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification essay.<>4]Compare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.<>]Visual artsOne of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may submit essays purchased from an essay mill (or \"paper mill\") as their own work. An \"essay mill\" is a ghostwriting service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty or academic fraud, universities and colleges may investigate papers they suspect are from an essay mill by using plagiarism detection software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.<>1]Music \r\n \r\n \r\nUniversity students, like these students doing research at a university library, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they have read.Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples.In the visual arts, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work's composition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes from the word essay's meaning of \"attempt\" or \"trial\").An Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is required when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US Federal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core qualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive Service must demonstrate.\"After School Play Interrupted by the Catch and Release of a Stingray\" is a simple time-sequence photo essay.EmploymentIn the realm of music, composer Samuel Barber wrote a set of \"Essays for Orchestra,\" relying on the form and content of the music to guide the listener's ear, rather than any extra-musical plot or story.In countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, essays have become a major part of a formal education in the form of free response questions. Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (see admissions essay). In both secondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university students must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences,<citation>needed] mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.PhotographyClassification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while division is the breaking of a larger whole into smaller parts.<>]Reflective \r\n \r\n \r\n<a
