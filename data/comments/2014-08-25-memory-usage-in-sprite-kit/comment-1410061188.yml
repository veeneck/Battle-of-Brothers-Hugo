body: 'First of all, I want to congratulate both you and your brother for this awesome ideea and intiative.
I think this blog is a great resource of usefull things to take into consideration when venturing into the indie gamedev world. I&#39;ve read all your blog posts (and some posts written by Chris) - mainly because I&#39;m an iOS developer and in my spare time I fiddle around with SpriteKit too. I&#39;m from Romania (east Europe) and I don&#39;t currently have the resources to start such a project on my own, but some day I hope to do something like this. 

I also apreciate the honesty of your thought process. I watched all your youtube videos and I can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s next. It&#39;s fascinating to see all this progress. 

There are developers who are shy or take too much pride in their work and do not want to share any WIP (being afraid of criticism). I also tend to fall in this category of people (sadly) and I am truly jelous of your openess. Maybe I sound stalky but I am curious to know more about your background.

I think the youtube initiative is really awesome and I would encourage your brother to do the same thing (even though you have only a few views for the moment). I really have a sense of how your game takes shape compared to Chris&#39; game.

Keep up the good work!

P.S.: Sorry to be so off-topic, but I didn&#39;t really know where to post this (I guess not many people go to the very first post).'
