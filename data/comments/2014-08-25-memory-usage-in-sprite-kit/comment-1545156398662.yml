  My programmer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP. I have always
  disliked the idea because of the expenses. But he's tryiong none the less.
  I've been using WordPress on various websites for about a year and am worried
  about switching to another platform. I have heard very good things about
  blogengine.net. Is there a way I can transfer all my wordpress content into
  it? Any help would be really appreciated!
