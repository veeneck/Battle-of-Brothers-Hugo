body: 'This seems really cool but I can&#39;t seem to get it to work. It&#39;s not giving me any errors either. Looks like it&#39;s not saving, but it is creating the plist file. Really frustrating that it&#39;&#39;s not giving any errors. Has anything changed with the latest versions of Xcode/ios?'
