body: 'I know this has been posted for a while...I am just having one problem. 

When I try to call GameData.save(), Xcode thinks the save() function has a parameter of type &quot;GameData.&quot; Additionally, Xcode gives the following error: &quot;Use of instance member &#39;save&#39; on type &#39;GameData&#39;; did you mean to use a value of type &#39;GameData&#39; instead?&quot;
 
I try putting GameData.save(GameData). When I do that, however, Xcode throws the same error as above.

I can&#39;t figure out how to make it work. thanks'
