body: 'What I decided to do is make my own file called &quot;DefaultGameData&quot; and replace &quot;DefaultFile&quot; in code with &quot;DefaultGameData.&quot; Also, I had to update some of the code with swift 2 and I used your gist in the comment down below. After a few hours of testing and googling, I got it all working. If I post my code online, I&#39;ll put a link here so that people can see how to implement your class in swift 2.

Thank you SO MUCH for this great tutorial. It makes saving data in SpriteKit so easy!

Thanks again,
Noah'
