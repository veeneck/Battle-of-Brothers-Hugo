body: 'I have a real question now: In your code, the file you are copying to &quot;GameData.plist&quot; is called &quot;DefaultFile.plist.&quot; However, there is no such thing as &quot;DefaultFile.plist&quot;. I assume this is just a placeholder, so what do put there instead? I tried &quot;Info.plist&quot;, but that gives me an error.

Thanks'
