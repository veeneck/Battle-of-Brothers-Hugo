body: 'Well this will be fun and interesting to watch how this turns out!   One brother will have bragging rights for sure at the end.  Also, hopefully there will be 2 new good video games at the end.  I want to keep my options open on who I think might win until I see the games develop, but the brother who might know how to market and get their game out in front of customers might be the winner over who might be the best programmer, just saying.  Do you know what I mean?  Good luck to both Chris and Ryan!'
