body: 'Hi there, 
depending on your needs I believe there is a better way. 
Instead of using and creating multiple images for the mask, you could use a single image with a gradient and then use a shader to animate it smoothly, with a single uniform. Furthermore you could also add a noise texture to make it visually more interesting.

I also did a quick and dirty test in Unity3d (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/768434/pathAnimation.zip), so you can check it out yourself

What the end result looks like http://imgur.com/2HE3Ilt
(please note that the gradient isn&#39;t perfectly smooth, because the steps aren&#39;t spaced evenly, since I created the texture rather quickly. 
With a smooth, evenly spaced gradient the result would be much nicer)

The fragment shader:
float4 frag (v2f i) : COLOR 
{
	// set color
	float4 col = _Color;
	
	// apply mask
	col.a = tex2D( _MaskTex, i.uv ).r * 1.2; // mutliply by 1.2 so _NoiseTex can&#39;t hide passed positions
	
	// if gradient is smaller than _Position + _FadeAmount col.a is zero
	// if gradient is bigger than _Position col.a is one
	// values in between get smoothly interpolated
	col.a *= smoothstep(_Position + _FadeAmount, _Position, tex2D( _GradientTex, i.uv ).r);
	
	col.a -= tex2D( _NoiseTex, i.uv ).r * 0.4; // mutliply by 1.4 to reduce _NoiseTex&#39;s effect
	
	return col;
}

with _FadeAmount you can set how large the transition should be and with _Position you can set how far the line should be drawn (please note, _Position doesn&#39;t perfectly go from 0 to 1 here, since _FadeAmount adds a small offset and the lowest and highest values in the gradient aren&#39;t either)


Once the paths are less likely to change, a good way to improve performance would then be to put thetextures in the r,g,b,a channels of a single texture, thereby also reducing memory footprint and tex2D calls'
