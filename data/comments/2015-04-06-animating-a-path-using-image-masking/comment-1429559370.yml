body: 'Thanks for the detailed reply, Stefan. When I wrote this post Corona didn&#39;t support custom shaders, but they actually just launched that feature last week - https://coronalabs.com/blog/2015/04/15/custom-shader-effects/. I should be able to now use your example to make my path animation a bit easier.'
