body: 'Best tip I could give to anyone making games is not to be so critical of every little aspect of the game, we all tend to want to make everything perfect but the reality is that it never is. My father once told me something when I was a kid that has stuck with me over the years and applied to everything I do in programming from games to applications and that is that more often than not the only person that will notice an imperfection is the person making it the average person will never even notice.

My point being focus on game play as you can always upgrade the eye candy. 

Just my two cents.'
