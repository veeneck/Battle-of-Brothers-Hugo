body: 'Thanks for the notes. Refactoring is hit or miss for me. When I&#39;m not rushed, I tend to enjoy the process of reading about, learning and implementing new code techniques. There is a satisfaction with having clean / efficient code. I&#39;d say that happens ~35% of the time. The other 65% of refactoring I tend to hate. Either way, it always results in productive new code -- I never regret it.'
