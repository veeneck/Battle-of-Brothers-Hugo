body: 'By the way, it seems the u_sprite_size uniform has been removed as of iOS10, at least according to Apples docs:

https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skshader

&quot;Since the removal of u_sprite_size, if your shader requires the size of the sprite in pixels, you are responsible for creating the necessary uniform or attribute.&quot;

There is sample code for recreating this in the docs themselves, but thought it was worth pointing out.'
