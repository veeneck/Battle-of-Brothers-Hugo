body: 'It&#39;s working for me so far, but I don&#39;t have a ton of objects on the screen. I have seen it slow down when I add some extra logic to the redrawing functions, though. I may end up not indexing the objects on every frame, but only when they really need to be indexed. For me, that means when characters are moving across the screen.'
