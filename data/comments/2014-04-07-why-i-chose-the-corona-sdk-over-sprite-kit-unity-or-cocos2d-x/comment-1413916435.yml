body: 'I feel all these software IDE houses like they sell excellent IDE where a one need just a good idea, press the button and voila - game is done, next week there is 100k of dollars on your bank account! And what with these monthly, annual fees!? When I bought VS I paid for it and VS is my forever. These monthly fees for using their software is non-practical and I directed myself to other framework distributes, maybe they aren&#39;t mighty but no hassle with fees. Also, all these community pretend there like they are nuclear scientist and hard to get answer. Shame. I wish these cell phone never appeared.'
