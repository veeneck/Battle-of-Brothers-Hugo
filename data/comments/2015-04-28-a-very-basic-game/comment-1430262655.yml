body: 'Having used Corona SDK for about a month and not having any prior lua experience before that, I can say that I am utterly blown away by what you&#39;ve accomplished so far. I love the way this game is turning out. I&#39;m a huge D&amp;amp;D/Pathfinder fan, so the RPG and storytelling aspects really appeal to me. Great job!'
