body: 'Right now the video is at the same resolution as yours, 80 seconds, and 100MB. I&#39;ll play around with shrinking things as much as possible, but I don&#39;t know any way of getting around a large file. My game has a lot of assets and I won&#39;t be able to get the game under the WiFi cap limit even without the video, so I&#39;m not too concerned with the large file size.'
