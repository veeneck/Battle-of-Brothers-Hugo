This competition between you and your brother grabbed my interest from the start, so great job to both of you on the progress you&#39;ve made. It has been fun to trace your concepts from inception to where they are now. I&#39;m not sure if this is a preferable place to provide feedback on your intro video, but I will anyways. If the text in the video will be voiced, and therefore not displayed, it would affect what follows. Hopefully you find it helpful regardless.

One of the things that struck me right away was that the storyteller stayed on screen for nearly the entire video. It became difficult to follow the monologue from the speaker and keep on eye on the new images that were coming into frame (and their animations). Overall, I missed pieces from the text while I was looking at the changing imagery, or I missed animations in the images while I was reading the monologue. It would be helpful to focus on one image at a time, full screen, with the text laying over it.

Example progression:

[Storyteller scene] with lead-in text

switch to

[Castle scene] with &quot;A tale of castles&quot;

switch to

[Hero scene] with &quot;and heroes&quot;

switch to

[Evil Silhouette] with &quot;and evil.&quot;

Opening the video with the storyteller scene is sufficient to communicate the fact that the rest of the intro is being narrated by him. The user can then take the posture of one of the listeners, and the art (which is stunning) can be appreciated much more fully. The viewer will be free to consume the story, without distractions. If the text will not be shown, and the story told with audio, I feel that a similar mentality still applies. The orator need not be displayed past the beginning of the video (but again at the end).

I really loved the final scene, in which the sky castle panned into view when it was being referenced. It seems like it will lead into the gameplay well, and sets up things nicely. If you do end up seeing the storyteller multiple times throughout the video, it would be helpful to adjust the characters slightly. A different gesticulation for the speaker or some other change would help indicate time had passed during the monologue, and it would loosen the feel of the entire video. I am sure you will continue to tweak it, but there were some cadence issues I noticed with the video as a whole. Sometimes text left very quickly, and sometimes pauses between scenes were too long. You may be familiar with the story, the art, and the direction of the game, but the user will not be.

Great work thus far, to both you and your brother,

Rand'
