body: 'Thanks, Ben. Promoting the blog will hopefully take care of itself if I provide quality content. Building readership is a long slog, though. You have to start somewhere, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about getting only a small readership. Worst case scenario is that you learn by doing and have something tangible you can show prospective employers, clients, etc. Just go for it!'
