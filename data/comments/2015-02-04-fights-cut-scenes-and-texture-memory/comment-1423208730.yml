body: 'Hey Christopher,

I gave spine a try before, but the results were really awful - especially with my isometric PoV. I don&#39;t blame spine but my lack of experience with the software and my complete lack of any art skill. Maybe it&#39;s time to invest a little more time to see if it&#39;s a viable option.'
