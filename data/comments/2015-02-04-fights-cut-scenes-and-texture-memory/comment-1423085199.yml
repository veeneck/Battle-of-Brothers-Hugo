I think you may have overlooked a 4th option :)

So I have been looking at your animations and I think you could drop A LOT of that sprite sheet by using Spine and just add bones an do the animation that way there software site is here http://esotericsoftware.com/

Which would drop you down to 1 spritesheet for the actual body parts more than likely and then using spine you can animated them and run them in corona just like you would a 3d model.

I would look into this type of setup asap before moving forward on more characters because if you use this method you can add more characters and even animations etc. 

Not to say anything about any extra texture memory you are going to put on the system like dialogs, ui, effects etc. and so forth.'
