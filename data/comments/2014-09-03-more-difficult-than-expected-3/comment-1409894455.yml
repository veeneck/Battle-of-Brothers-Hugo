body: 'Yeah I think that would be a super welcomed change to the genre.  If you made it kind of like an RTS/tower defense hybrid.  If certain towers are overtaken, you can&#39;t build any more of that unit, etc.  One game mechanic I always like to throw out there for games like this, is maybe you could have a unit in place(like a demon of some sort) that a player can spawn if they sacrifice a certain number/type of unit.'
