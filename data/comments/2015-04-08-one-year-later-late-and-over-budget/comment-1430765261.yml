body: 'Hey Chris, its a shame the game isnt ready for release yet, I think quite a few people(including me) were looking forward to it. Now that you&#39;ve gained more experience with CoronaSKD, if you started the project again, do you think you could do it within the original 12month timeline?
Also how long before the game is released?'
