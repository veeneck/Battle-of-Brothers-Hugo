body: '6 months to a year delayed for a project originally planned to be finished in a year, that&#39;s a huge amount of time! How are you going to do for your salary and expenses? You say you&#39;re gonna be 2000 USD over budget, but does that include the months of work coming up?

Good luck with this! I&#39;ll keep reading this blog because it&#39;s really a unique perspective on game development.

All the best!'
