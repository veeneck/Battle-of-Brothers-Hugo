body: 'I&#39;m currently 2k over budge and that number will still probably grow. Most of the illustrations, animations, and music is completed and/or paid for, so it won&#39;t grow proportionally to how late the game is. That number does not include salary. I&#39;m funding this through personal savings, so it would be more expensive if you were to also add the cost of living. 

It has been a costly learning experience, but I think the investment has been worth it considering how much I&#39;ve learned and grown. I think I paid more for less in college, and I didn&#39;t have a finished game at the end of college =)'
