As to Corona, I&#39;m a big fan of them and I think they&#39;re probably the best choice for a beginner who needs to actually write custom code and needs customization in their app. Game salad may be even easier, but they might not offer all of the functionality of Corona. Unity has a bit of a learning curve and Cocos2d would likely give you a lot of problems if you don&#39;t have any programming experience. If you plan on programming, Corona will also be tough at first, but there are some great tutorials out there. I used http://masteringcoronasdk.com when I was starting out and it helped a lot. Feel free to email if you have any questions.'
