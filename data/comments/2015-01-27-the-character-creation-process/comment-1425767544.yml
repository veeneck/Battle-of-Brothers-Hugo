Gorgeous character design. The characters remind me of one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, Mulan. I was wondering, I&#39;m thinking about writing a 2d iPhone/Android app for my family business with my wife, and I wanted to ask what you thought about working with the Corona SDK. I&#39;m not a programmer, although I can code in HTML and CSS. I thought that Lua might be something I might be able to handle. 

How do you feel about Corona overall? Does it feel like the engine is a major limiting factor in your work on this game? Do you know how Ryan feels about it too? 

Just curious. I&#39;ve also been looking at Unity and Cocos2d, and another small outfit called Gamesalad. Our app ideas usually involve access to device cameras, like the iPhone&#39;s camera and Camera Roll, and I didn&#39;t know if Corona would allow for things like that.

Kind regards, and best of luck on your current project and future endeavors.'
