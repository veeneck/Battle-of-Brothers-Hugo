      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was going to sit down this morning and write a post on why I&amp;#8217;m choosing Sprite Kit, but instead I feel the need to express how fun game development has been so far. It will be interesting to track my mood over time because I do see the tedious nature of the craft lurking around the corner, but for now I&amp;#8217;m loving life.
