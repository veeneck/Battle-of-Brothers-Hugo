      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I wrote a line of code, I knew that I wanted my game to have a story. And, of course, not just any story. It had to be a decent story with sound, art, movement and voice overs. Basically, a movie. Now that I&amp;#8217;m 75% through the process of creating and implementing a story, I thought I&amp;#8217;d share some lessons learned about this surprisingly difficult task that cost me around &lt;strong&gt;$7,600 and nearly 3 months&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of my development time.
