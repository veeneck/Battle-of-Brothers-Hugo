    <p>Finding an artist has been my biggest fear since this competition started. There are so many things that could go wrong when you have to depend on someone you don&#8217;t know to contribute a third or more to your project. The style may not be a match, they could leave half way through the project, the budget estimations may be way off &#8212; the list goes on and on. I must say though, I&#8217;ve gained confidence in art contractors in the two weeks I&#8217;ve been speaking with them. I thought I would share some of my notes.</p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="where-to-look">Where to Look</h4>

<p>I started out by looking for people directly and emailing them via their websites. Places I would search included:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hireanillustrator.com/i/" target="_blank">Hire an Illustrator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.behance.net" target="_blank">Behance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.deviantart.com" target="_blank">DeviantART</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/" target="_blank">/r/gamedevclassifieds</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dreamup.com/find/artists/" target="_blank">DreamUp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After sending out 15 or so direct emails, I felt I had a grasp on illustrators. I was having trouble finding an animator, so I decided to post on a job forum. The <a href="http://forum.deviantart.com/jobs/offers/" target="_blank">deviantART job offers </a>section appeared to have high activity, so I gave that a shot. I received about 20 good leads through the forum post, so I consider that a success.</p>

<p>Lastly, ask friends. I&#8217;m only mentioning this because it provided leads I was completely unaware of. For example, I asked one of my friends in Business Development if she knew any artists, and it turns out two of her good friends work for game companies. Prior to that, I would have bet she had no connections or interests with gaming.</p>

<h4 id="pricing">Pricing</h4>

<p>My initial question was whether or not I should post my budget, which is roughly $10,000 per artist (animator and illustrator). In my initial emails, I did not list it and only followed up with it if I sensed doubt over the legitimacy of my game. This got me some ballpark figures. In my forum post,  I did list it to get as many leads as possible, but that made filtering out talent hard. In the end, I would recommend against posting your budget.</p>

<p>Revealing your financials isn&#8217;t the end of the world as most artists I&#8217;ve spoken to give honest hourly rates, and do paid trial runs in your desired art style. As for pricing, my <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/thinking-about-the-cost-of-art" target="_blank">guesstimate post</a> from two weeks ago was almost spot on. ~30-50 custom sprites, or more than that if you reuse as much as you can. For example, just replace weapons on existing sprites, or add a small armor change.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it turns out there is no magic price, as the art style makes a huge difference. For animators, hourly costs and trial runs appear to be the best way to narrow down cost. For illustrators, I&#8217;ve seen a few with fixed tiered pricing based on the amount of detail or characters you require. That said, I still feel like estimating the cost for an entire project is tough to do in advance.</p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>

<p>Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to has been super cool. Some just aren&#8217;t interested, which is fine. I&#8217;m reluctant to force someone into such a large project. For the others, even those you like, I can&#8217;t emphasize enough how important I feel a trial run is. Things to look for in a trial:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are they open to criticism?</li>
<li>Do they respond to emails promptly?</li>
<li>Will they be able to adapt to your style?</li>
<li>Do you get along with them?</li>
<li>Are your requests focused enough, or are they too vague?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only has this process built up my comfort with artists, it has made me refine the scope of my game. I feel like I have realistic expectations now.</p>

<h4 id="style">Style</h4>

<p>Don&#8217;t let style be your determining factor for ruling out a potential artist. For example, I knew I wanted to explore a brush stroke style of illustration. That led me to <a href="http://beyondthebox.biz" target="_blank">Matt Forsyth</a>. After speaking with Matt, I had him do a trial piece. Next, I needed to find an animator who could match that style. I came across <a href="http://spudonkey.com" target="_blank">Gareth</a> who had this <a href="http://spudonkey.com/Pixel-Art" target="_blank">pixel based animation</a>. I don&#8217;t love pixel art, but I did love his attention to detail in the animation. For that reason, I felt a trail run would be helpful to see if he could adapt his style. Below is the progression so far:</p>

<p>The last point is to be open to new styles. I found <a href="http://www.dangerdom.com" target="_blank">Dangerdom</a> to have a unique take on art, and to be completely unique on the app store. I&#8217;m currently brainstorming what that art style would look like in a tower defense world.</p>
