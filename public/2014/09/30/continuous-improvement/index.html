    <p>As planned, I was able to continue programming over the last two weeks and add some more features and a new character to the demo. I also spent a little time working on some new character concepts, battlegrounds, and animation preparation.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv_7GOVxA1E&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv_7GOVxA1E&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<h4 id="added-ability-points">Added Ability Points</h4>

<p>Each character will have different abilities, ranging from basic attack to ultimate attacks, and those abilities will be limited by some form of power or resource management. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s going to exactly play out, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t set up the code for when I do know. Right now, each character starts with a few resource points and each ability requires points to be used. A character regains a point after each turn, so they can save up points by not using stronger attacks during their attack phases.</p>

<h4 id="added-disengage-bash">Added Disengage/Bash</h4>

<p>I explained the concept of engagement in <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirchris/back-to-programming">the last update</a>, and this time around I added the functionality to disengage. The idea is that some characters will have an ability to disengage from combat without being penalized. In the video example I added a bash ability to the warrior class that does direct damage and also allows him to disengage with the enemy. This could be a useful ability to get him out of a tight spot or to help a friend in need.</p>

<h4 id="added-abilities-over-time-stonestance">Added Abilities over Time/StoneStance</h4>

<p>Most actions and effects happen immediately but some will be on a delay. Poison, for example, would be a lingering effect that does most of its damage over consecutive turns and not when it is initially inflicted. I added that type of functionality by implementing the stone stance ability to the warrior class. This ability is a self-buff that the warrior class casts to greatly increase the chances that he blocks an enemy melee attack. It would come in handy if he&#8217;s low on life or expecting to get beat down by a bunch of baddies.</p>

<h4 id="added-an-archer">Added an Archer</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the final game is going to have a pure archer type of class, but that&#8217;s one of the animations I had on hand and ready to go. It was less important to add a specific game character as it was to see how long it took me to get another character into the game. A few weeks ago I completely re-wrote my character creation classes so that the code is as modular and reusable as possible. Things turned out great and I was able to get the new character in there in less than a day.</p>

<h4 id="added-abilities-to-the-archer">Added Abilities to the Archer</h4>

<p>For similar reasons as adding the archer class, I wanted to see how long it took me to add new abilities to a class. Again, things went very smoothly with the new code and I was able to add an attack, double attack, and flaming arrow attack to the archer. The animations are pretty cheesy, but adding the real animations will only take a few lines of code when they arrive.</p>

<h4 id="more-artwork">More Artwork</h4>

<p>I continued to work with an illustrator and animator on character concepts, level designs, and animations. As far as progress goes, level and character designs are about 40% complete, and the animations are 5-10% complete. Here is some concept work of the first evil character making his way into the game.</p>

<h4 id="coming-up">Coming Up</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to plan what&#8217;ll be going on over the next couple of weeks, because <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan">the enemy</a> is getting married. I&#8217;m pretty sure this is where I&#8217;ll pull ahead in the competition because he isn&#8217;t prepared to handle married life and especially kids if they&#8217;re in the immediate future.</p>

<p>With the development time I do get over the next couple weeks, I plan on adding some more core functionality to the game. I&#8217;m waiting on the animation artwork to catch up with the programming I&#8217;ve done so far and I think I should spend some time on loading/saving game state, dialogue screens, character upgrade screens, and other functionality that will definitely make it into the game.</p>

					<h5>$25,000. 2 brothers. 1 year. 0 experience.</h5>
					<p>Armed with little to no game development experience, we're setting out to see who can make the best game. 
					In the spirit of learning and following a passion, we're each going to take one year and a $25,000 budget to see how far we can get. 
					It begins on April 7th, 2014. We'll be documenting the journey.</p>
