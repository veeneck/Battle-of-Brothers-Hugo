 				<p>The official winner of this competition (and bragging rights) is going to be the brother whose game makes the most money, but all won&#8217;t be lost if I come closer to my end goal of becoming a game developer. <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/b/brucelee385747.html">Bruce Lee</a> said that, &#8220;a goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at&#8221;, and here are the targets that I&#8217;ve set out to hit.
</p>

<h4 id="product">Product</h4>

<p>I want to release a polished game and avoid adding another mediocre iOS game to the world. I think this is my most ambitious goal because I&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/postmortem/">post-mortems</a> and <a href="http://nyphoon.com/hardships-of-a-game-developer/#.UzGmYNz_VFw">stories of hardship</a>. Releasing anything is hard work and I have serious doubts as to the feasibility of releasing a polished iOS game (think <a href="http://www.rubicondev.com/glwg/">Great Little War Game</a>) in one year, with no experience, and on a budget of 25k. Meeting this goal is my number one priority because if I can launch a polished game, then I&#8217;ll have likely met my other goals.</p>

<h4 id="financial">Financial</h4>

<p>My financial goal is to earn $.01 more than Ryan and win this competition. I do think I&#8217;ll be disappointed if the only people who buy my game are my wife and mom, but I won&#8217;t be upset if this game doesn&#8217;t earn much money. This is my freshman year of game development and I&#8217;m ok with paying a price to learn. My main goal is to gain an understanding of game development, and I understand that education can come at a cost. I&#8217;ll be upset if what I learn can&#8217;t help me earn a living from future games, but it&#8217;s too soon to focus on money.</p>

<h4 id="educational">Educational</h4>

<p>As a freshman in game development, I want to learn the <strong>fundamentals</strong>. I stress fundamentals because it&#8217;s natural to want to jump into something new and accomplish too much too soon. I&#8217;ve gone down that road and the result is a hack with few long-term learning benefits. I want to lay the foundation to a future in gaming and my three main education expectations are to learn:</p>

<p><strong>A New Programming Language</strong> : Whether it be C, C#, Lua, JavaScript or some other language, I want to come out of this having learned a new programming language. This means I can&#8217;t rush things by cutting and pasting tutorials without understanding the syntax and structure of the underlying code. It means spending time on obscure bugs, even though there might be a &#8220;quick fix&#8221; on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a>. I need to find out a language&#8217;s limitations and experience the problems that are time sinks for beginners and trivial to experts.</p>

<p><strong>Game Art</strong> : I have no intention of becoming an artist, but I do intend to learn how art is created and how artists work. Even though I&#8217;m not a web designer, I became a better web programmer and teammate by understanding how web design works. I would expect it&#8217;s beneficial for game programmers to understand how games are designed.</p>

<p><strong>The 4 P&#8217;s of Game Marketing</strong> : Marketing 101 teaches us that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jerome_McCarthy">successful products</a> depend on the correct mix of the right product, sold at the right price, in the right place, using the right promotion. I need to figure out what type of game people want to buy, how much it should cost, which platform to build upon, and how to promote a game. This is going to take trial, error, and money but an understanding of game marketing will be useful with any game I ever build.</p>

<h4 id="personal">Personal</h4>

<p><strong>Join the Community</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d like this experience to result in the meeting of new people and me becoming part of the gaming community. If I learn how to create a game, launch a game, and even make a little money, it would be disappointing if it happened in isolation. It&#8217;s hard to succeed in isolation and it&#8217;s important that this competition introduces me to new people and new ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Beat the Enemy</strong></p>

<p>Ryan likes to ask people who they think is faster between the two of us. This is because we participated in a 100 m sprint when he was 16 and I was 18. Ryan beat me by a fraction of a second and is quick to point it out anytime we&#8217;re moving in the same direction, either physically or mentally. If I lose this competition, then I will know about it for the rest of my life. I do not want to lose this competition.</p>

<p><strong>Enjoy the Ride</strong></p>

<p>When I created my last company, <a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a>, I was younger, less experienced and broke. I risked a lot in that venture and while I wouldn&#8217;t trade the 7 year experience for anything, I can honestly say that I didn&#8217;t really enjoy the ride. Paul Graham, one of our investors and founder of <a href="http://ycombinator.com">YCombinator</a>, said that a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html">startup is</a>, &#8220;Compressing your whole working life into a few years&#8221; and I would agree with the sentiment. I feel like the stresses involved with that type of startup override the joys, and I don&#8217;t think this experience has to feel the same.</p>

<p>I want to enjoy the ride this time around and that means a few things. It means my nights and weekends belong to my friends and family. It means I won&#8217;t get sick due to lack of sleep and stressing every little setback. And it means I won&#8217;t stop exercising for the sake of a few more hours of code. I believe constraints and balance are critical to my long-term success and that my professional and personal goals can succeed by setting boundaries now.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m Nicholas Mamo - founder of Nyphoon Games (<a href="http://nyphoon.com/">http://nyphoon.com/</a>), from where you referenced the &quot;Hardships of a Game Developer&quot; article! Sure, game development can be a real chore and hardships do abound, but nothing beats the feeling of satisfaction when something you make is appreciated by a community of gamers and developers. So without further ado, create! Share! And keep making games! Best of luck on your thrilling journey! :)</p>

						<h5>$25,000. 2 brothers. 1 year. 0 experience.</h5>
						<p>Armed with little to no game development experience, we're setting out to see who can make the best game. 
						In the spirit of learning and following a passion, we're each going to take one year and a $25,000 budget to see how far we can get. 
						It begins on April 7th, 2014. We'll be documenting the journey.</p>
