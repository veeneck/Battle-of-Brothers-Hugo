      <title>Isometric Projectile Trajectory in Swift and SpriteKit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you launch a catapult, grenade, arrow, or any other projectile in an isometric world? I had to joy of figuring that out over these past two days, and I thought I would share. Before jumping in, let me point out that the code below is for my specific use case, and is not a full featured framework. So, you&amp;#8217;ll still have to understand the concepts, but if you&amp;#8217;re Googling for help this will hopefully get you on the right track.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/saving-game-data-in-spritekit&#34;&gt;saving game data in SpriteKit&lt;/a&gt;, and that code is now completely out of date. Swift 3 has brought about all sorts of fun changes, so it&amp;#8217;s time for me to provided some updated code.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#8217;re wondering, game development is hard to keep up with when dealing with an infant. Now, I went into this knowing the first 4 weeks would be baby and family first. But, I secretly had hope that I would have some spare time to keep the game moving forward. Now that the first month is over, I&amp;#8217;ve worked a grand total of:

      <title>Charge, Flee, Economy &amp; Scene Management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;January 2016. Getting close to that two year mark. This month marks the first full month of iteration on an existing &amp;#8220;platform&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;m rapidly iterating through smaller features instead of spending months implementing core code. Because of that, I&amp;#8217;m also going to change these status updates slightly. I&amp;#8217;ll have my videos go through all the incremental changes, while the posts look through the bigger picture of what&amp;#8217;s left. This should allow for easier tracking of overall progress. Additionally, I can save thoughts, ideas, and other general topics for the blog posts.

      <title>Detecting and Managing Memory Leaks Between SKScenes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Memory leaks suck. You know they exist, and you dread the day you have to track them down. In SpriteKit, I&amp;#8217;ve encountered two main types of leaks. One is where the entire scene is not deallocated after transitioning to a new scene. The other is where memory is constantly being used up while interacting with a scene. For the latter, you have to use Instruments in XCode, or comb over your code, to get a handle on what is happening. But, for cleaning up scenes after you&amp;#8217;re finished with them, here are a few tips that simplified the process for me.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been quite the 2 months. In anticipation of becoming a father, I&amp;#8217;ve significantly picked up my work efforts. It&amp;#8217;s not that I wasn&amp;#8217;t trying before &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s just that deadlines have a way of motivating me further. I&amp;#8217;ve tackled a few major rewrites / problems with the foundation of my code, and I now have a working &amp;#8220;game&amp;#8221; that is actually installed on 3 devices via Testflight! With all of this in place, I can iterate on the platform and slowly work towards a rough alpha and then polished beta.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This purpose of this post is to document some of the frustrations with pathfinding. I&amp;#8217;m finding that it is too boring to try to implement every map at once, so I&amp;#8217;m touching pathfinding every other week or so. As a refresher, the video below has served as my primer on &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/GameplayKit/Reference/GKObstacleGraph_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/GKObstacleGraph&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GKObstacleGraph&lt;/a&gt; whenever I need to revisit pathfinding. So, if you&amp;#8217;re a SpriteKit / GameplayKit user, you may find my approach interesting.

      <title>A Month of Combat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This update is similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/a-month-of-pathfinding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my last update&lt;/a&gt; in that I spent a month trying to improve the framework of a more complicated portion of the codebase. Last time was pathfinding, this time is combat. In addition to improving combat, I wanted to focus on data integrity and porting combat pathfinding to iOS9 / GameplayKit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This post has been backdated to keep the documentation accurate &amp;#8212; the game was in this state as of Oct. 1st.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of August I challenged myself to get pathfinding under control. In truth, if I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure it out I would be forced to consider making the game turn based instead. So, I set out with a giant todo list containing many edge cases to solve. Fortunately, the main branch was merged in yesterday, so I&amp;#8217;m in an infinitely better position than I was. It&amp;#8217;s been an exhausting month, so I&amp;#8217;m ready to move on. Let&amp;#8217;s have a look at what&amp;#8217;s been completed, and what issues still remain.

      <title>Progress Followed By No Progress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been nearly two months since my last status update. To quickly sum up those two months, June was extremely productive while July was almost a waste. June consisted of implementing reusable menus, music, sound effects, button effects, volume controls, unit management and more. Basically, a lot of foundation type elements needed for a game. Unfortunately, I started playing with iOS9 in July, which happened to be both a necessity and a time sink. Finally, just last Friday, I finished the contract with the composer, so all of the music for the game has been completed.

      <title>Understanding Shaders in SpriteKit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re new to game development, you&amp;#8217;ve probably heard of shaders but don&amp;#8217;t quite understand them. If you&amp;#8217;re new to SpriteKit, you&amp;#8217;ve probably hit a few speed bumps working with shaders. Since I&amp;#8217;m still learning more about the two, I figured it would be nice to put up a concrete example that covers cropping and effects using shaders. Specifically, we&amp;#8217;ll cover two concepts:

      <title>Spawns, Heraldry and UI</title>

      <guid>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/spawns-heraldry-and-ui/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This update is broken into three main events. First, I created spawn zones for the player to place their troops before battle. Second, I fixed off screen heraldry, and refactored the code to make it more flexible. Lastly, I played with consistent UI classes that will work for every screen. And in between all of that, I fixed bugs and worked with the composer (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manfredoniamusic.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tony Manfredonia&lt;/a&gt;).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An unsteady foundation is still a foundation, right? I&amp;#8217;ve continued my work of porting all code into a single project. You can roughly play the game from start to level 2 right now. This means loading, saving, world map, placing troops, enemy waves, game over state, resuming, story, and more. There is a lot of core code in place.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past year I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a bunch of different code bases learning new concepts. For this update, I decided to piece together a first build of my &amp;#8220;game&amp;#8221; to get rid of redundant bits of code. I&amp;#8217;m left with an app that has menus, navigation, saving, loading, and cutscenes. While it&amp;#8217;s still far from an enjoyable game, it&amp;#8217;s cool stuff to have a foundation to work with.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent every day of the past two weeks working on story. The good news is that it was worth the effort. There is a noticeable jump in quality, and it makes me feel a bit of pride for the product. I&amp;#8217;m now optimistic that one or two more rounds of polish along with some sound and music will make it a worthy purchase for gamers. The bad news is that I still have one or two more rounds of polish to go, which turns into 2-4 weeks of work. Music starts on May 4th, so at least I have a concrete deadline driving me. Otherwise, I fear that I could tinker on this forever.

      <title>A Bit of Story and a Sprinkle of AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past two weeks have been 75% story and 25% in game work. That trend will continue for the next few updates as I prepare to send the story of to voice and sound. The encouraging news on the story front is that the first round of polish has resulted in noticeable improvements. Most importantly, the new chat bubbles add animation and interest while also allowing me to add dialogue to travel and battle scenes. As far as battle goes, enemies now have a basic spawn service and will attack the closest target they can find.

      <title>The True Cost of Adding Story to a Game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I wrote a line of code, I knew that I wanted my game to have a story. And, of course, not just any story. It had to be a decent story with sound, art, movement and voice overs. Basically, a movie. Now that I&amp;#8217;m 75% through the process of creating and implementing a story, I thought I&amp;#8217;d share some lessons learned about this surprisingly difficult task that cost me around &lt;strong&gt;$7,600 and nearly 3 months&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of my development time.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Story, story, story. 8 of the 10 days over the past two weeks have been spent preparing story assets, implementing them into the game engine, revising dialogue, and getting the cutscenes to work. It has been extremely tedious, but it feels great to have finished a first pass.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://particletree.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Particletree&lt;/a&gt; days, we had a friend copy edit any major pieces we wrote. Inevitably, she would catch something that was poorly written. So, for a game that contains almost 15 minutes of dialogue, I figured that I would have to spend money on a second pair of eyes to help me out. Early on in the process, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mikewaterston.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mike Waterston&lt;/a&gt; emailed me with a desire to help out. He wasn&amp;#8217;t in it for the money &amp;#8212; he just wanted to help a game come to life. So, after a few back and forths, we&amp;#8217;ll be seeing this story through to the end together.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When searching for tips on how to save game data in SpriteKit, most posts explain how to save one variable (high score, for example). In that regard, this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thinkingswiftly.com/saving-spritekit-game-data-swift-easy-nscoder/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thinking Swiftly post&lt;/a&gt; was extremely helpful, and is where a majority of the code below comes from. I just wanted to extend that post, and look at how an entire object could be saved in a self contained way.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a lot over the past two weeks. Work has started on melee combat. I&amp;#8217;ve hired a composer! But most of all, I&amp;#8217;ve been consumed with cutscenes. When I started this process, I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that the decision to add a story to my game would end up costing me ~30% of my budget and an equal amount of programming time. Now that I&amp;#8217;m actually implementing the story, I&amp;#8217;m starting to understand all of the implications.

      <title>Create Skippable Cutscenes in SpriteKit with Timing Functions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cutscenes are a labor of love, so it is hard accepting that some people just don&amp;#8217;t care. That story that took months to bring together may be amazing to you, but to others it is just an inconvenience. So, for that reason, we have to make cutscenes skippable. However, I didn&amp;#8217;t want to just settle at skipping the entire scene. I wanted to also make it skimmable for the speed readers, or those who are mildly interested.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in awhile, a composer will email me asking if I would like for them to work on the project. I keep their names with the idea of getting back to them when I&amp;#8217;m ready to focus on music. Anthony contacted me out of the blue with an eagerness, varied skill set, and past experience &amp;#8212; all which compelled me to start a trial. So far, trial is going great.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s funny how the tasks that should be easy end up consuming the most amount of time. As of this writing, there is no easy way to outline text in SpriteKit. It&amp;#8217;s common to see approach that &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19211827/what-would-be-the-best-approach-for-outlining-or-dropshadowing-a-font&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;add a shadow node&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes more contrast is needed. Here&amp;#8217;s what I have discovered.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finally able to start writing game code, and it is fun. Now that learning and performance issues are almost behind me, I was able to implement  ranged combat and death, which is great to see in action. In addition to that, steady progress has been made on the world map, and early story boards are coming along. This update also marks the end of the first contract with Scott, my illustrator, but we&amp;#8217;ll be entering a second contract shortly.

      <title>My Take on Health Bars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health indicators are found in almost every game. As Chris pointed out, they come in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirchris/health-display-roundup&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;variety of shapes and sizes&lt;/a&gt;. When it became time to think about them in my game, I wanted to add something that was functional, but also unique or interesting in some way.

      <title>SpriteKit: CPU gains from caching enumerateChildNodesWithName</title>
      <link>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/spritekit-cpu-gains-from-caching-enumeratechildnodeswithname/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who follow me know that I&amp;#8217;m working on a game that will have ~200 nodes on the screen updating every frame. Because of that requirement, I&amp;#8217;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/joy-of-debugging-command-swiftc-failed-with-exit-code-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;constantly looking&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/memory-usage-in-sprite-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how I can&lt;/a&gt; incrementally &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/now-were-rolling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;improve performance&lt;/a&gt;. Slowly but surely, I&amp;#8217;m making this game a well oiled machine. Today, I stumbled on a significant slow down, and the resulting fix that shaved off 16% CPU usage: caching &lt;code&gt;enumerateChildNodesWithName&lt;/code&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are moving along much better now. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t say moving quickly just yet, but they&amp;#8217;re at least moving. I&amp;#8217;ve overcome a lot of technical hurdles and learning curves in the past 3 months. The latest of those was how to support 100-150 units on the screen at once. Serious progress has been made in that department. And, as always, I&amp;#8217;ve received amazing illustrations and animations from Scott and Liron. Lastly, I&amp;#8217;ve dabbled a bit in icon making.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working through a particularly nasty issue, so it feels right to document it for anyone else who encounters it. Also, just to serve as a note and reminder that game development is full of unexpected, time consuming tasks on a near weekly basis. This most recent problem &amp;#8212; releasing a build to an iOS device fails to compile, but it works on the simulator. Specifically, this occurs when I try to change the Swift compiler optimization level.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so that title is sort of doom and gloom. Really though, my mood is pretty good. I&amp;#8217;m a married man now! On the work front, the difficulty I&amp;#8217;m encountering is programming difficulty, which I feel is in my control. That&amp;#8217;s always better than art, story, music, sound or gameplay difficulty. Current pain points? Pathfinding, and moving units as a formation.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as I have been working nearly non stop with an illustrator, I have been going back and forth with Liron, my animator. I eased into a contract with her due to fear from my last animation contract. We started with a $90 trial, and then another $500 trial. She did an amazing job on those, so the full contract began.

My original concept for a tower defense game just wouldn&amp;#8217;t work the way I had envisioned. So, instead of moving towards a standard tower defense game, I decided to change direction and make a sort of squad based defense game. This update covers that transition. Most importantly, I feel all of my problems right now are technical ones, and that the art will work out (or be adjustable).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s amazing how long it can take to make your first level. It seems so simple at first. Just put a castle here, some grass there, and call it a day. But, questions arise. What art style should we go with? Will sprites be light or dark, so that we know what color grass and flooring to use? How wide do walkways need to be? Basically, figuring out your first level is like figuring out your entire game. Because of that, my first level continues to change. I thought it would be neat to take a look at where it started, and where it is now.

      <title>How To Implement Squads and Formations, Part 1</title>

      <guid>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/how-to-implement-squads-and-formations-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an awesome article on Gamasutra about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131720/coordinated_unit_movement.php?page=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Coordinated Unit Movement&lt;/a&gt;. They also have a companion post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131721/implementing_coordinated_movement.php?page=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;implementing said movement&lt;/a&gt;. However, the posts are from 1999, and they deal mainly in pseudocode. Also, I&amp;#8217;m convinced there is absolutely nothing else on the entire internet explaining the topic. So, an experienced developer may be able to read the ideas and know how to implement them, but it has been a bit of a struggle for me as a new developer. I&amp;#8217;m going to try to document a step by step implementation of formations, squads, and movement for someone who hasn&amp;#8217;t done it before. I&amp;#8217;ll be writing in Swift / Sprite Kit, but the code should be easy enough for anyone to follow. I also welcome corrections / improvements from experts.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past two weeks have been a real shot to my confidence. It turns out that a perfect game does not live inside of my head. Instead, a game with real usability, budget, and gameplay issues lives in my head. Researching some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/0-to-art-in-two-weeks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;questions I needed answers for last week&lt;/a&gt; revealed that there isn&amp;#8217;t always a perfect solution, and that my game idea needs refinement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris, Scott and I came to an agreement on an illustration contract that would involve Scott alternating weeks in which he works for us. My portion of the contract was $8,000. It ended up finishing mid-week, so I extended it the extra $380 to round it off. The goal was to finish all illustrations for the game during this time. That did not happen because I changed my game midway through. Still, a lot was accomplished.

Our contracts are structured in a way that either party can leave, and payments are spread out. Anything paid is no refundable, and anything completed must be delivered. This allows flexibility for both parties.

This was also prompted by my current level running at 55-60MB before any gameplay action or characters loaded on screen. That memory usage seemed a bit high, so I decided this was an issue that I needed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o1U2pWcR34&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;delve into&lt;/a&gt;. In hindsight, most of this is basic to an experienced game developer, but I found the process to be quite fun. You can just read my lessons learned below if you don&amp;#8217;t want to follow my detective work.

This update marks the beginning of my first contract with an illustrator, and the revelation that I have 1000 unanswered questions about my game. So, while I&amp;#8217;m now super motivated, I&amp;#8217;m also a bit stressed since every design decision I get wrong directly amounts to spending more money.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#8217;m working with other people, all sorts of questions come up about my game. How many illustrations where there be? How many actors? Is the script finished? What tone should the game have? Pretty much every single thing you could think to ask about the game needs an answer. Everyone I have spoken to says to start art / sound / music / copy editing / storyboarding early in the process. Don&amp;#8217;t wait until the last minute, they say. And while most people have my best interests in mind, it is still a ton of work to answer questions in a thoughtful way.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are moving quickly now. I&amp;#8217;ve started to line up as many character artists and animators as I can to do some trial runs. Ideally, I&amp;#8217;ll find one super talented person, or multiple people who have complimentary skill sets. Trials get expensive, but they&amp;#8217;re worth it to find the right person. More should come in next week.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past two weeks did not go as planned. What started out as a coding week that would involve balancing unit attributes turned into a full on art blitz. I received a lengthy, somewhat painful, and costly introduction into the world of art. At the same time, I received the invaluable jolt of excitement and motivation that comes from working with other talented people.

      <guid>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/my-experiences-searching-for-an-artist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding an artist has been my biggest fear since this competition started. There are so many things that could go wrong when you have to depend on someone you don&amp;#8217;t know to contribute a third or more to your project. The style may not be a match, they could leave half way through the project, the budget estimations may be way off &amp;#8212; the list goes on and on. I must say though, I&amp;#8217;ve gained confidence in art contractors in the two weeks I&amp;#8217;ve been speaking with them. I thought I would share some of my notes.

So, I plan to contract out a couple of artists to see their take on my existing level and characters. In the end, I imagine I&amp;#8217;ll spend $1,000 on this sort of purchase.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last update marked the beginning of my conversion to Swift, and this update marks the end &amp;#8212; almost. I continued to be plagued by conversion issues (64 bit this time) and time off (Bachelor party), but also enjoyed faster refactoring and cleaner code. I&amp;#8217;ve now gotten the game back to playable with 10% of the code left to convert. Small details like synchronized walking animations, missing damage over time and other bugs remain, but I finally feel like I&amp;#8217;m in the clear. This is a huge thing because for a second there I was a bit depressed and questioned my choice to convert to Swift.

My first quarter of game development consisted of many &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/the-shaping-of-a-game&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/its-not-all-sunshine-and-rainbows&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lows&lt;/a&gt;, but most importantly I still consider it &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/possibly-the-most-fun-ive-had-professionally&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;among the most rewarding things I&amp;#8217;ve done&lt;/a&gt;. From a purely stats perspective, I think my productivity can be summed up as a strong start, medium middle, and lacking end. I thought it would be fun to look at some concrete numbers, so here is what I came up with.

      <title>Swift Distractions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been awhile since my last update. 4 weeks to be exact. And to top it off, my game has fewer features than it did the last time you heard from me. There are two reasons for this: The introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/swift/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, and the perfect storm of distractions.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve ventured into the unknown while working on my game &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know what art costs. This is becoming an issue because I have all sorts of grand ideas for levels, characters and features. It is clear that art, or more directly my budget, will be the deciding factor on the scope of my game.

      <title>Challenges You May Encounter While Porting Your SpriteKit Game to Swift</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/swift/&#34;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; comes at a perfect time for me. I’ve been working on a SpriteKit game in Objective-C for 10 weeks now, and some of the code is definitely in need of refactoring. Refactoring is known to be tedious, so being able to learn a new language during the process is a plus. I’ve been taking notes of any challenge I’ve come across during the conversion.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If last week was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/feature-rush&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;feature rush&lt;/a&gt;, this week was a feature overload. I&amp;#8217;ve slowly been breaking out of the learning phase and into the implementation phase. I definitely know what needs to happen now &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s just a matter of doing it. Exciting times are ahead because I can now begin testing features that will make my game unique. My update this week introduces a lot of those features, including a defendable castle and dynamic spawn points.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lighting effects were curiously missing from SpriteKit in iOS7, so I&amp;#8217;m happy to see them appear in iOS8. Here&amp;#8217;s a quick look at what you can expect from the light source / raycasting implementation.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last update I had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/and-then-there-was-a-playable-game&#34;&gt;playable game&lt;/a&gt;. This update has been spent trying to add as many features to the game as possible, which has been an enlightening process that has revealed two lessons. First, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/179501/rapid_prototyping_tips_for_.php&#34;&gt;need to prototype&lt;/a&gt; since you don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s fun until you try it. Second, while my code is getting better, it still isn&amp;#8217;t ready to scale to an entire project. Each time I add a new asset or feature, I&amp;#8217;m finding myself copying a lot of code. By going through the motions, it&amp;#8217;s becoming clear what needs to be fixed up.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on the catapult for my game, I came across the first of many design problems I will face. Turns out it is much easier to critique another game&amp;#8217;s design than it is to create your own with confidence. In my situation, I was deciding between a player controlled catapult and an automated catapult. I was so torn that I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/25eakp/when_is_player_control_no_longer_fun/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posed the question to /r/gamedesign&lt;/a&gt; and had to write the code for each. Let&amp;#8217;s look at the results.

      <title>Learning Sprite Kit by Example</title>
      <link>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/learning-sprite-kit-by-example/</link>

      <guid>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/learning-sprite-kit-by-example/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hated school. I hate technical books. Generally, I feel like I can learn faster with the unstoppable trio of myself, Google and wonderful online communities. The trouble with game development is I don&amp;#8217;t know what questions to ask. In web development, I can search how to make two elements sit next to each other and find what I&amp;#8217;m looking for. In game development, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have looked for a finite state machine, much less double dispatch for physics. I may be late to the party compared to other developers, but I&amp;#8217;m finding myself humbled by both books and open source projects that are extremely well crafted.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t look now, but I think my Xcode project just turned into a playable game. That&amp;#8217;s right, you heard me correctly. User input, gold and a game over state. I would almost say it&amp;#8217;s time to wrap things up and call it a win for team Ryan.

      <title>Can a Mobile Game Have a Great Story?</title>
      <link>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/can-a-mobile-game-have-a-great-story/</link>

      <guid>http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/can-a-mobile-game-have-a-great-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forget the big ports like X-Com or Final Fantasy Tactics and you&amp;#8217;re left with mediocre stories in most mobile games. Hits like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja excel in gameplay, not story. Even standout indie games like Hunters and Battleheart fall short. I expect almost every mobile game I buy to be light on gameplay and even lighter on story. I thought the same would be true for my game, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Adventures-Princess-Mr-Whiffle/product-reviews/0983613125/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Adventures of Princess and Mr. Whiffle &lt;/a&gt;by Patrick Rothfuss changes everything.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With update #3, I bring you my most challenging two weeks so far. As you can see from the featured image, working with Finite State Machines, and AI in general, plays a big part in my frustrations. When this cycle began, I was hoping to have wave movement, group formations and melee combat working. Since only one of those three goals was accomplished, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at what went right and what went wrong.

      <title>Handling zPosition in a 2.5d World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, dealing with zPosition in a 2.5d game is about as complicated as everything else in game development &amp;#8212; it will be harder to handle than you think it should be. For example, how should you handle moving a sprite from behind a tree to in front of a tree in perceived depth. While the initial drawing of objects is straightforward, things become tricky once they start moving around. Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at how I&amp;#8217;m approaching zPosition in my Sprite Kit game.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game development has always been intimidating to me. There have always been so many unknowns that learning how make a game, let alone write in C, seemed unachievable. The past two weeks have been shocking to me because the tools and libraries available have come so far that game development is now accessible. I feel like I did when developing for the web and &lt;a href=&#34;http://jquery.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://prototypejs.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prototype.js&lt;/a&gt; came out. It&amp;#8217;s an amazing time and indie games will only become easier to produce.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was going to sit down this morning and write a post on why I&amp;#8217;m choosing Sprite Kit, but instead I feel the need to express how fun game development has been so far. It will be interesting to track my mood over time because I do see the tedious nature of the craft lurking around the corner, but for now I&amp;#8217;m loving life.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When learning a new language or environment, some things that should be trivial seem to take forever. Once you learn how to do simple tasks, it&amp;#8217;s hard to remember how you originally struggled. So for that reason, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to keep a running log of useful code snippets that were stumbling blocks at some point. Anything that I think I&amp;#8217;ll reuse, or had trouble understanding as a beginner will be added as &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/veeneck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a gist to my Github account&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not usually a fan of books, or any tutorial for that matter. I prefer to look at docs and start playing around. But since I know so little about game development, it makes sense to look at someone else&amp;#8217;s code and project to get an idea of their code structure and approach.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether it be video games, web development or mobile software, coding is coding. And launching something is hard. Every developer knows that. One of the main difficulties comes from design. Or, more specifically, polish. Anytime I can exercise my design muscles, I&amp;#8217;ll be better prepared the next time around.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting parts of documenting a journey is seeing how wrong (or right) you can be in the beginning. Whether it be budget, timing, quality, success, enjoyment or one of the many other measurements &amp;#8212; something will not go as planned. I thought it would be fun to try to write out some concrete guesses about the future so that they can be revisited.
