      <description>&lt;p&gt;This expense wasn&amp;#8217;t a lump sum payment, but about 10 payments made over the course of a few months. I&amp;#8217;m at the end of my original contract with an illustrator, and so far he&amp;#8217;s delivered:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>$1829 on Animations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two more characters were completed, which brings me to a total of 4 characters. This expense was about $450 more than I had originally budgeted for due to the unexpected time associated with animating weapons. Basically, characters with weapons will cost a little bit more to animate, and I&amp;#8217;m fine with that.
