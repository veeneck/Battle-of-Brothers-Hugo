			<h4>Looking for the enemy?</h4>
			<p>Chris is older than me, but he has wasted his years starting a family instead of honing his development skills. Anxious to step out of his shadow, my youth and superior intelligence will clearly crown me champion.</p>

				<h4>What's this contest about?</h4>
				<p>Armed with little to no game development experience, the Brothers Campbell are attempting to make video games for a living.
				We believe the best way for us to learn is to do what comes naturally to brothers &#8212; Compete! 
				The challenge is to see who can make the most successful video game on a budget of $25,000 and in one year’s time. 
				The duel begins on April 7th, 2014 and we'll be documenting the journey.</p>

				<hr class="dots" />

				<h4>How will you determine the winner?</h4>
				<p>It’s simple. The most profitable game wins. We’ll have 6 months to market the game after the one year development deadline on April 7th, 2015.</p>
