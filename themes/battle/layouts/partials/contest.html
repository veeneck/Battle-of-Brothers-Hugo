	<h4>What's this contest about?</h4>
	<p>Armed with little to no game development experience, the Brothers Campbell are attempting to make video games for a living.
	We believe the best way for us to learn is to do what comes naturally to brothers &#8212; Compete! 
	The challenge is to see who can make the most successful video game on a budget of $25,000 and in one year’s time. 
	The duel begins on April 7th, 2014 and we'll be documenting the journey.</p>

	<h4>How will you determine the winner?</h4>
	<p>It’s simple. The most profitable game wins. We’ll have 6 months to market the game after the one year development deadline on April 7th, 2015.</p>
