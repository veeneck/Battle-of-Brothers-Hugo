I was using Corona&#8217;s [free product][1] for awhile, but I decided to upgrade to the pro subscription once I continuously encounter bugs with live builds on the free trial. My game is still a ways off from completion, and I wish I could have used the free trial problem free for a little bit longer, but I knew I&#8217;d have to fork up the money eventually.
