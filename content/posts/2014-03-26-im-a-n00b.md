All journeys have beginnings and today is where my journey starts. While I might not be as useless as the n00b [MTG][1] card above, I do lack most of the skills required to build a video game. Advancing from beginner to competent game developer will be a difficult task, but I&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;s where this quest leads.

<!--more-->

The status update section of my blog is where I talk about anything and everything directly related to the development of my game. I will routinely document game updates, screenshots, budgets, programming problems, art direction, marketing and anything else that comes to mind. This comprehensive documentation will hopefully provide insight into the life of a beginner game developer and help future indies get started with their game development dreams.

I haven&#8217;t started developing my game yet and don&#8217;t have anything to share, so I&#8217;m going to talk about my goals for the next couple of weeks. While I don&#8217;t have much game programming knowledge, I do have 10 years of web programming experience and I did once make a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

I think my programming background enables me to quickly understand basics of a new programing language and game development framework , so I plan on experimenting with 3 frameworks over the next couple of weeks. For a number of different reasons, which I&#8217;ll document in a later blog post, I will be testing out [Sprite Kit][2], [Corona SDK][3], and [Unity][4].

I&#8217;d love any feedback that you might have about frameworks, languages, or anything about beginner game development in general so please leave a comment or [contact me personally][5].
