I&#8217;ve been working with the an illustrator and animator for a few weeks now they&#8217;ve produced the world map, multiple battlefield maps, concept characters, character turnarounds, and 2 animated characters (semi produced). I&#8217;m pretty close to staying on budget so far, but I can see how both artists could end up costing a bit more than I originally thought.
