I&#8217;m starting to reach out to a few artists, and it is difficult to determine cost, style, availability and friendlinessÂ just by exchanging a few emails. So, I plan to contract out a couple of artists to see their take on my existing level and characters. In the end, I imagine I&#8217;ll spend $1,000 on this sort of purchase.

Hopefully, $400 or so that is made by the artist I chose to work with will go back into the final game. I feel this is the only way to get to know someone who will be such an important part of the overall product. I plan to write more on this topic later, but the exciting part is that concept art is on the way.
