Things are moving quickly now. I&#8217;ve started to line up as many character artists and animators as I can to do some trial runs. Ideally, I&#8217;ll find one super talented person, or multiple people who have complimentary skill sets. Trials get expensive, but they&#8217;re worth it to find the right person. More should come in next week.
