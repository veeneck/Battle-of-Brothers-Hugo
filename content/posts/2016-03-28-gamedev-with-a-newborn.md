I did everything in my power to try and get an hour per day, but it just wasn&#8217;t happening. From family visiting, doctors, the unpredictable natureÂ of newborns, and helping my wife out, it&#8217;s just hard to get any serious work done.

As we enter month two, I&#8217;m starting a guaranteed 25 hours a week with the ability to go up to 35 hours when the schedule is smooth. Let&#8217;s see how it goes.
