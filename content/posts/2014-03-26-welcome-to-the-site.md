Hi there, I&#8217;m Chris and welcome to my game development blog. In case you came directly to this site and not through the [splash page][1], let me give you a quick intro as to what&#8217;s going on.

<!--more-->

A few months ago, [my brother][2] and I decided to turn a long-standing dream of launching a game development company into a reality. While we&#8217;re not new to [creating a software company][3], we are new to game programming and game development. To jump-start our learning we&#8217;re doing what comes naturally to brothers. Compete! We&#8217;re hosting a competition between the two of us to determine who can make the better game. The rules are pretty simple. We have one year to develop a game from scratch and on a budget of $25k. We&#8217;ll then have 6 months to market our games. Whoever makes the most profit wins.

We don&#8217;t want to develop our games in a vacuum, so we&#8217;re each documenting this competition on our personal blogs. That is where we will write about anything and everything related to game development as a whole and the development of our individual games. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to not only share what we know and help out other indie gamers, but also learn from and interact with the game development community.

Please feel free to comment on anything you read around here, and don&#8217;t be shy about reaching out to me via [email or twitter][4] either.
