Chris, Scott and I came to an agreement on an illustration contract that would involve Scott alternating weeks in which he works for us. My portion of the contract was $8,000. It ended up finishing mid-week, so I extended it the extra $380 to round it off. The goal was to finish all illustrations for the game during this time. That did not happen because I changed my game midway through. Still, a lot was accomplished.

<!--more-->

  * Story completed (~16 illustrations)
  * World map finished
  * Credit and decision screen
  * ~30 characters illustrated
  * 6 levels designed

With that finished, I still have to complete:

  * 6 more levels, plus touch up some of the existing ones
  * Title screen, hero screen, army screen
  * Marketing (website image, game icon and logo)
  * Polish, polish, polish.
