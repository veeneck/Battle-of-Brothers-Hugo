April has been in my sights for some time now. After a move, some traveling, a bit of relaxation, building out an office space and designing this site, I&#8217;m finally ready to start working on games. Actually, this dream is a lifetime in the making.

As long as I can remember, Chris and I have always been interested in games. Two distinct memories come to mind. First, playing Mortal Kombat at the local arcade. Second, playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO:_Enemy_Unknown" target="_blank">original  X-Com</a> in my parents basement. And mixed in with those are tons of hours spent playing EverQuest, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, Call of Duty, Warhammer, MTG and so on. I think I&#8217;ve always wanted to do something with games, but real life has gotten in the way. Now that this is real, I couldn&#8217;t be happier.

Typically, this type of post (a status update that can be tracked in <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/timeline" target="_blank">my timeline</a>) will focus on progress I&#8217;ve made towards finishing my actual game. Things I&#8217;ve spent money on, marketing efforts, overcoming technical challenges or introducing new features are the sorts of topics that will be covered. But for this first week, I&#8217;ve got nothing to show.

So instead of looking at what I&#8217;ve done, let&#8217;s quickly cover what I&#8217;ll be doing when I&#8217;m not fixing bugs on this website. I plan to jump right in to the <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/spent-15-on-video-tutorials" target="_blank">tutorial I bought</a>, and hopefully have a good feel for Sprite Kit. At least, I hope I enjoy working with it enough to settle on it as my engine of choice so I can move on to productive tasks. Beyond that, who knows? I have some reading to do before deciding the most effective way to learn.
