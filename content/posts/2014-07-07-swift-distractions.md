It has been awhile since my last update. 4 weeks to be exact. And to top it off, my game has fewer features than it did the last time you heard from me. There are two reasons for this: The introduction of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">Swift</a>, and the perfect storm of distractions.

#### Two Weeks Vacation

I missed a two week cycle due to travel. Family, a wedding, and <a href="http://www.ragnartrail.com/locations/appalachians-wv" target="_blank">Ragnar</a> were on the agenda. Swift was introduced the day I left, so I was at least able to read <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11" target="_blank">the book</a> while I was gone. It was also at this point that I decided to rewrite my entire project, which I&#8217;ll get into later.

<div class="inlineimg">

</div>

#### World Cup

It&#8217;s possible to watch the World Cup and program at the same time, right? Turns out the real answer is more like &#8220;Kinda.&#8221; I had a good setup going:

<div class="inlineimg">
  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-793" src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BqWu5M2IUAAbSV6.jpg-large-1.jpeg" alt="BqWu5M2IUAAbSV6.jpg-large" width="700" srcset="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BqWu5M2IUAAbSV6.jpg-large-1.jpeg 1024w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BqWu5M2IUAAbSV6.jpg-large-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BqWu5M2IUAAbSV6.jpg-large-1-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
</div>

The problem is that you can&#8217;t get into the zone when there are 6 hours of soccer in a day. So while I made some progress with Swift, my productivity saw a big drop during the group stage of the cup.

#### Swift

Finally, during the last 8 days or so of the 4 weeks, I made some real progress. My port to Swift wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/challenges-you-may-encounter-while-porting-your-spritekit-game-to-swift" target="_blank">without challenges</a>, but now I&#8217;m about a week away from where I was with my Objective-C code. Moral has been low during the refactor, so it is nice to see the end in sight. Instead of writing about the code changes, have a look at the video if your interested in Sprite Kit / Swift code, or game dev in general.
