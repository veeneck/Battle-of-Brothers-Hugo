Up until this update, everything that I did was basically learning and testing basic concepts that could be applied to many types of turn based games. Characters moved, attacked, died, etc. I&#8217;ve known that I wanted to make a turn based game, but I didn&#8217;t know exactly what I was going to build. That all changed this time around, because over the last two weeks I decided what game I want to build, created an art design document, and contracted an illustrator to draw preliminary sketches.

#### It was Time to Make a Decision

The goals at the end of my last status update were to finish refactoring my code and add more functionality to the game. I finished the refactoring part, but once I got back to my game, I realized that any new features that were added might not make it into an actual game. I didn&#8217;t want to waste time on unnecessary features, so I wanted to figure out exactly what I wanted to build.

To be honest with you, I was kind of hoping that I would have some sort of ah-ha moment where I just absolutely know what game to build. I hear stories about artists being struck by inspiration at [completely random times][1], and like J.K. Rowling, I was pretty sure that was going to happen to me. Maybe it would happen while lying in bed, or running, or in the shower. It would just be a magical bolt of inspiration that entered my head and had to be made into a game. Well, after 4 months of running, showering and sleeping, I still had no clue as to what I really wanted to make.

So last week I sat down with a pen and paper and started to write down ideas. And for 4 days every idea that I came up with just didn&#8217;t feel right. Many of the ideas weren&#8217;t bad, but they were too costly, or too hard, or too abstract. I was actually getting pretty disheartened with this entire process, because I felt like I was getting nowhere and wasting time. To make things worse, [the competition][2] has known exactly what he wanted to build since day 1. But something changed halfway through the 5th day of brainstorming. Something clicked and I furiously wrote down what I now think is a solid start to what I&#8217;m going build.

#### My Game

What I want to do build is a game that tells a short story. There will be a beautiful world, unique characters, and small-scale turn based combat to help tell that story. The story takes place in a high fantasy/medieval type of world and it&#8217;s ultimately about good vs. evil. Although I don&#8217;t have the time or money to make a game similar to The Banner Saga or Final Fantasy Tactics, those two game are where I&#8217;m drawing a lot of my inspiration.

I know that all sounds clich√©, and I don&#8217;t know all of the game&#8217;s details, but I did make a 20 page art design document that explains what my world looks like and the outline of my story. I am so happy with the world and the story that I contacted an illustrator to start brining this thing to life. We&#8217;re still in the trial phase to see if his style matches what I have in my mind, but things are looking promising. The image at the top of this page is still a rough sketch and where we&#8217;re currently at, but here are some of the pieces that got us to that concept.

#### What&#8217;s Next

I&#8217;m will continue working with the illustrator to see if his style is the right fit for my idea, and if it does then we&#8217;ll continue to build the world map. I need start doing a little less thinking and a little more programming, because I now have a better sense of what features I&#8217;m going to need. A major challenge that I see coming up is how to make the combat interesting and balanced, but I&#8217;m ready to start experimenting.
