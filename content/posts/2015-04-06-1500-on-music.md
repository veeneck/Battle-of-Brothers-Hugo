I&#8217;ve entered into a contract with [Brendon Williams][1] to compose the game&#8217;s music. He&#8217;ll be doing everything from intro music, battle music, world map music, and any other types of music that come up. Brendon recently started with the music for the intro movie and it&#8217;s [sounding awesome][2].
