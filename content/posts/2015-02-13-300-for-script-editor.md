Back in our <a href="http://particletree.com" target="_blank">Particletree</a> days, we had a friend copy edit any major pieces we wrote. Inevitably, she would catch something that was poorly written. So, for a game that contains almost 15 minutes of dialogue, I figured that I would have to spend money onÂ a second pair of eyes to help me out. Early on in the process, <a href="http://www.mikewaterston.com" target="_blank">Mike Waterston</a> emailed me with a desire to help out. He wasn&#8217;t in it for the money &#8212; he just wanted to help a game come to life. So, after a few back and forths, we&#8217;ll be seeing this story through to the end together.
