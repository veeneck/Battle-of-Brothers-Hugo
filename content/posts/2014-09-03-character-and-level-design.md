I had just started working with an illustrator when I last left off, and most of my time over the last two weeks was spent designing some pretty cool characters and battlefields. I was also able to contract a character animator, who is now working on the game&#8217;s first character animations.
<!--more-->

My first goals with Scott, my illustrator, was to design the game&#8217;s first level and character. Those two assets will set the tone for the game&#8217;s art direction, so getting that right was pretty important. I wanted the first level to answer a few questions about workflow and artwork, including:

**Map Sizing**
  
On a 2850 x 1800 illustration, the battlefields are made up of rhombuses measuring 120px in width and 60 px in height. Scott likes to work on a larger sized canvas, so we had to make sure that the mockups I gave him scaled correctly. We also had to make sure they look OK on different mobile devices.

**Nature**
  
The world map has a low poly look, so it&#8217;s important that natural objects in the battle scenes carry over that low poly and angular look.

**A Man Made Object**
  
It&#8217;s not necessary that man-made objects have the same low poly look as natural objects, but they need to look like they&#8217;re part of the same world.

**Symbols**
  
In the game&#8217;s world, there are 5 main symbols that represent the five lands. I wanted to get them all in the game early so the future use of those symbols is consistent.

With that in mind, Scott created the following illustration, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.

<div class="inlineimg">
  <img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bridge-1.jpg" alt="bridge" width="800" height="505" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" srcset="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bridge-1.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bridge-1-300x189.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bridge-1-768x485.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />
</div>

I also tasked Scott with creating the first character for the game. There weren&#8217;t as many goals with the character as there were with the level design, but this character is important for scale. He&#8217;s of average height and medium build, so he&#8217;ll be used as the benchmark for future characters. He&#8217;s called a Rune Mage and here&#8217;s how he looks:

<div class="inlineimg">
  <img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/runemage-1.png" alt="runemage" width="500" height="230" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1135" srcset="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/runemage-1.png 500w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/runemage-1-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />
</div>

The Rune Mage has magical powers derived from the runes inscribed on his body and he fights for the good guys. He does look a little menacing and doesn&#8217;t have that Gandalf look that&#8217;s typical in magicians, and that&#8217;s kind of the goal. Why does a wizard have to be frail? I won&#8217;t completely avoid stereotypes with the characters in this game, but I do want to add my own spin on fantasy archetypes. Scott made a bunch of other characters, but we&#8217;ll save those for later.

Another objective of first two weeks with Scott was to get a feel for how much time it takes to create these assets. I am on a budget, so the game has to scale in accordance to how much artwork is created. I have a better feel for how long characters and levels take now, and I believe the game will have somewhere around 15 characters and 20 levels. Everything honestly takes more time than I had initially thought, but I think I&#8217;ve made the game pretty scalable and it won&#8217;t hurt to remove some cut scenes or go a little bit over budget.

One thing that has surprised me is how much planning I&#8217;ve been doing for the game. Creating pixel perfect level mockups, character concept files, game story ideas, and a number of other non-programming related tasks has pretty much taken up all of my time. I&#8217;m trying to make things as efficient as possible for the artists, and while that has taken away from programming, I believe more content will ultimately make it into the game.

The other big news from this last week is that I believe I&#8217;ve found an animator. I contacted a number of artists on [Carbonmade][1], made a [help wanted blog post][2], and paid for a job listing on [Behance][3], and I was fortunate to have found [Dustin Bolton][4]. I think his work is awesome and he made a great demo of my character walking, so I signed a contract with him to provide my character animations. Dustin is in the process of 3D modeling the Rune Mage now, and I look forward to reporting his progress during the next update.
