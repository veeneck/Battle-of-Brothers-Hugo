Wow, can you believe that my last post was July12th, 2016? It's been almost two years. Well, there are a few reasons for that which I've covered in a separate post. As for the game, there have been plenty of changes. Since the last update, I can't think of a single system that hasn't been touched. The update video will do a good job highlighting the most significant changes.

Video Update

Now that you've seen what I've been up to, the next thing you should do is go and read my recap of the past two years.

#### How Far Along Is The Game?

This is a tough question to answer. You can play levels 1 through 4 almost entirely. There are still the occasional crashes, but the features and abilities are in. Some are in basic states while others are more fleshed out. The system in levels 5 through 12 are just expanded versions of those already in place. So, code wise, a lot of work is nearing completion.

What still has a long way to go is polish. Things need to be balanced. Effects need to look good. Animations, UI, and feel all need work. From this perspective, the game is no where near finished.

And finally, there is a ton of missing art. To properly finish this game, I'll need updated art, animations, music, voice, sound, and cutscene work. It's a huge ask. I no longer think about how much work is left. I just chip away when I can.

#### What's Next?

I don't know. My hope is that the next status update won't be two years away. But, since this is now officially a hobby and not a business, life may take me in a different direction. I'll try to make sure my posting activity on this site accurately reflects the amount of work going into the game.
