Wow, can you believe that my last post was July12th, 2016? It's been almost two years. Well, there are a few reasons for that which I've covered in a separate post. As for the game, there have been plenty of changes. Since the last update, I can't think of a single system that hasn't been touched. The update video will do a good job highlighting the most significant changes.
