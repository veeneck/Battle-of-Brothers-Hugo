This expense wasn&#8217;t a lump sum payment, but about 10 payments made over the course of a few months. I&#8217;m at the end of my original contract with an illustrator, and so far he&#8217;s delivered:

<!--more-->

  * The world map and multiple animations to bring the world map to life
  * 18 original characters
  * 21 battlefield maps

I&#8217;m extremely happy with the illustrations I&#8217;ve received and am extending the contract by another $4000. I thought the original 10k budget would be enough for all of the game&#8217;s illustrations, but I was definitely a little bit naive about how much artwork my game needs and how long it takes to create artwork. This extra expense alone will probably put my over the competition&#8217;s 25k budget, but I&#8217;d rather be over budget than have a 75% completed game.
