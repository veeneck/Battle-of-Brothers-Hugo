Welcome &#8230; to Medieval Times! Ahh, I wish I was eating there right now. Wrong place though. You&#8217;re at my blog for the Battle of Brothers game development duel. My brother, Chris, and I will take a year and $25,000 to see who can make the most profitable game.

I think Chris summed up what&#8217;s going here best over on [his blog][1], so I&#8217;ll just leave a [link to the cross-post][2] with you. Thanks for stopping by!
