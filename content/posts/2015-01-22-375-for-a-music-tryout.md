Every once in awhile, a composer will email me asking if I would like for them to work on the project. I keep their names with the idea of getting back to them when I&#8217;m ready to focus on music. Anthony contacted me out of the blue with an eagerness, varied skill set, and past experience &#8212; all which compelled me to start a trial. So far,Â trial is going great.
