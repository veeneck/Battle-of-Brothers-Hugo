This purpose of this post is to document some of the frustrations with pathfinding. I&#8217;m finding that it is too boring to try to implement every map at once, so I&#8217;m touching pathfinding every other week or so. As a refresher, the video below has served as my primer on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/GameplayKit/Reference/GKObstacleGraph_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/GKObstacleGraph" target="_blank">GKObstacleGraph</a> whenever I need to revisit pathfinding. So, if you&#8217;re a SpriteKit / GameplayKit user, you may find my approach interesting.
