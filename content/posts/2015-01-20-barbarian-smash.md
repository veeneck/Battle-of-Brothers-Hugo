I feel like I made some really solid progress for the first time in a while, and I have some exciting stuff to share. A ton of little things were done, but the big accomplishments are the implementation of some awesome attack animations, battlefield animations, and world map animations. I also received some great new artwork and I gave my marketing efforts some much-needed love.

You can [view all of this week&#8217;s updates][1] with added commentary on YouTube or continue reading for a quick breakdown of each section.

The coolest visual update I have to share are a few of the Barbarian character’s basic attack sequences, which are the first attack sequences I’ve tested in-game.

</div>

In addition to the three attack animations, you can also see that I added the mage character’s hit and die animations, which happen after he takes a war hammer in the gut one too many times. There are still some minor kinks to work out with all of the animations, but I’m very happy with how they&#8217;re turning out. I actually just received some other great looking attack sequences, which couldn&#8217;t make it into this week&#8217;s update, but should be in the game next time.

#### World Map Animations

I want the world map to have some life, so I added a few small animations (with a lot of help from [my illustrator][2]).

The updates you can see in this video are:

  * A Waterfall
  * Birds Flying
  * Lights Flickering
  * Cube Pulsing
  * Clouds Drifting
  * Whale Splashing
  * Water Currents

Some of the animations need a little more work and I’ll probably add a few more things like rocks floating, volcano smoke, and more waterfalls. I&#8217;m happy with the initial results, and I think the movement makes the world feel more alive.

The other feature I started working on is the character path, which is the route that the game’s heroes take on their quest to rid the world of evil. I wanted something unique to my game’s art and not just yellow dots or footsteps and this is what we came up with.

I used image masking and some brush strokes to come up with this animation, and while I&#8217;m not super happy with the animation results just yet, I&#8217;m confident it will work with a little more love.

#### Battlefield Animations

Like the world map, the battlefields sometimes feel a little bit stale without any movement. I won&#8217;t be able to add animations to all of the battlefields due to budget constraints, but I was able to implement this pretty sweet teleporter.

#### Lots of Art

The illustrator just delivered the last character concepts and battlefield maps, so I have those assets completely finished. The animator also delivered two complete character animation sequences in addition to the animations I demo’d previously. I’m receiving artwork much faster than I can implement it into the game, and that&#8217;s a problem I don&#8217;t mind having.

#### Marketing Efforts

I’ve been slacking my marketing efforts so I took a day or two to get things rolling in that department again. I have about 4 or 5 blog posts written and in the queue, made more of an effort to [tweet game updates][3], and [jazzed up my YouTube page][4]. It’s really hard for me to switch gears from development to marketing, especially when there is still so much development ahead, but I have to try to remember to give a little more attention to the business side of things.

#### Next Up

In addition to the barbarian attack animations, I just received two complete character animations for the Knight and Evil Knight characters. I’m chomping at the bit to get into the game, so they&#8217;ll probably be the next project I tackle. I also have to spend some time thinking about how the story and cut scenes will come together because that&#8217;s the next step for the illustrator, now that he&#8217;s done with all of the character and battlefield illustrations. All in all things are really starting to get rolling and I should have some pretty awesome stuff to demo next time around.
