I wrote about a <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/my-experiences-hiring-an-artist-part-2" target="_blank">contract that I broke before it was finished</a>, and this amount accounts for that mistake. Our contracts are structured in a way that either party can leave, and payments are spread out. Anything paid is no refundable, and anything completed must be delivered. This allows flexibility for both parties.
