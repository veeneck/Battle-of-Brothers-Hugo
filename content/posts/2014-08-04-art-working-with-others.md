The past two weeks did not go as planned. What started out as a coding week that would involve balancing unit attributes turned into a full on art blitz. I received a lengthy, somewhat painful, and costly introduction into the world of art. At the same time, I received the invaluable jolt of excitement and motivation that comes from working with other talented people.

I wrote about my <a href="http://battleofbrothers.com/sirryan/my-experiences-searching-for-an-artist" target="_blank">experiences searching for an artist</a> earlier this week, and I thought that would be the end of it. I had found two talented people who I get along with, and I figured that we would be able to find a style that works. Unfortunately, one of those people was given a job offer he could not refuse, and the other had a style that was too expenses for animators to match. I talk about that in my status video of this week:

So, now I&#8217;m doing a trial run with three different animators, and I have found a different style of illustrator. Ultimately, I just want to find art that works well together and is in my budget. My one condition being that the art is not &#8220;generic cartoony&#8221; that most app store games have. I&#8217;ll provide a detailed update once the dust settles.

#### Organizing a Game

One of the huge benefits that came out of speaking with artists is that I needed to organize my thoughts. How many levels would there be? How many characters? What is the story, and how many story boards / cut scenes are needed? What art style inspires you? All of these questions resulted in a 20 page document, and two separate art documents. Instead of rambling over email, I will now be able to provide somewhat accurate figures and descriptions to the people I&#8217;ll be working with.

It will be interesting to look back and see how accurate I am, but here is my scope for an illustrator:

  * 12 level illustrations
  * 150 small, layered environment details (campfire, tent, house, etc).
  * 12 &#8211; 20 storyboard illustrations
  * 1 main menu illustration
  * 1 combat prep illustration
  * 1 world map
  * 6 character portraits (if they can’t be cut from one of the storyboards)

#### This Changes Things

As of now, I&#8217;ll no longer be aimlessly (and boring-ly) writing an engine for a rough concept. I&#8217;ll be implementing level 1. And then jumping to a story, which then goes to a battle preparation screen. I&#8217;ll be trying to create real particle effects. I actually feel like this is the turning point where I&#8217;ll be crafting a game, and not just writing code.

I can&#8217;t emphasize enough how much energy this has provided. Chris and I both have trouble sleeping, and excitedly talk about our games all day. Not only is the art exciting, but I have trouble letting people down which provides the necessary work ethic to keep up with the artists. I&#8217;m not sure how long this high will last, but this is one of the peaks on my journey for sure.
