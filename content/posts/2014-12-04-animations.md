It&#8217;s been a little while since the last status update, due to the holidays and a mean case of strep, but I have some pretty cool stuff to share. I had hoped to add the functionality for dialogue into the game, but my animator got back to me with some awesome animations and I just couldn&#8217;t wait to implement them. So here&#8217;s a look at 4 of the hero character animations hot off the assembly line.

There are some minor positioning issues to fix, but I&#8217;m really happy with the overall look of the animations so far. One thing I was worried about is the fact that the animations are being created in 3D even though I&#8217;m creating a 2D game. This was done so I can get more animations done for my money, but I did run the risk of the characters not looking quite right. I think the characters blend in really well and it&#8217;s tough to know they were made as 3D models. So far I think I&#8217;ve made the right choice.

In addition to the animations, I now have 20/20 of the game maps completed and 14/18 of the characters completed. Here is a look at a newly completed evil sorceress character and battlefield map.

I still have a good amount of work for the illustrator to complete, including cut scenes, marketing material, and some user interface artwork, and it does look like I&#8217;m giong to go overbudget in this area. One thing that I&#8217;m starting to realize is how much time everything to do with a game takes, so although I&#8217;m goign to go a bit over budget, it won&#8217;t break the bank. I can see how some games do break the bank, though.

As I had hoped after the last update, I really want to start implementing the character dialogue functionality. It&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s an extremely exciting feature to work on but because it&#8217;s critical to the game and probably the last major programming piece that I haven&#8217;t even touched. That being said, we&#8217;ll see what artwork arrives and if I&#8217;m able to resist the urge of adding awesome animations instead of writing kinda boring code.
