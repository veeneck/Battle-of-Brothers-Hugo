I&#8217;m not usually a fan of books, or any tutorial for that matter. I prefer to look at docs and start playing around. But since I know so little about game development, it makes sense to look at someone else&#8217;s code and project to get an idea of their code structure and approach.

I&#8217;ve been aware of  Steffen Itterheim and his work on <a href="http://koboldkit.com" target="_blank">Kobold Kit</a> for some time now, and quality always appears to matter. <a href="http://cartoonsmartblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/role-playing-games-with-sprite-kit/" target="_blank">Since Role Playing Games with Sprite Kit</a> is recommended on the Kobold Kit store, I figured it must be somewhat trustworthy. So, $15 down and I&#8217;ve got 4 days to knock out these video tutorials.
