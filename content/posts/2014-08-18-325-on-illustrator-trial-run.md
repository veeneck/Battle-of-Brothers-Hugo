I made a list of illustrators who I planned on contacting for trial illustrations, but I lucked out by having [Scott Pellico][1] go first. Scott illustrated a piece of my world map as a trial to see if his style was a fit for the world I&#8217;d like to create. He nailed it and I&#8217;m lucky to have found a quality illustrator on the first go.
