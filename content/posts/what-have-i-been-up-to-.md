Most people who come to this site would be under the impression that it is abandoned. That's partially true. But just because there is little activity here, that doesn't mean I've been doing nothing. The truth is that a lot has been accomplished, followed by burnout, followed by a crossroads that I'm now at.

In the summer of 2016, my daughter was 4 months old and I was determined to spend all of my spare time working on this game. For that year and a quarter between \~July 2016 and October 2017, I worked solely on the game. These weren't all 40 hour weeks because family comes first. Still, a good amount of time was put into the project. My latest status update shows some of that work, but it doesn't scratch the surface of what's been done. Documentation for each framework, performance testing, caching, a macOS build, refactoring, scrapped design decisions and on and on and on. 

If you had asked me in September 2017 when the game would be done, I would have confidently told you that summer 2018 would be a beta, and it would take $30,000 to $50,000 more for it to be polished enough to launch.
