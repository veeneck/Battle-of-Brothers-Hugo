This expense wasn&#8217;t a lump sum payment, but 4 payments made over the course of a couple months. I&#8217;m extended the original contract with the illustrator because the game has more artwork than I originally anticipated. The following illustrations were done for this update:

<!--more-->

  * All artwork for the cutscenes (~10 illustrations in total)
  * World Map Animations
  * Multiple changes to all battlefield maps to allow for animation and obstacles

There will be two more payments made after this update, so the major artwork is pretty much completed.
