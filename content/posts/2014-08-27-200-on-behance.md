I&#8217;ve been looking for an animator and the three methods of recruitment that I used were making a blog post, reaching out to people I admired on [Carbonmade][1], and paying for a job listing on [Behance][2]. I received 52 applications within 5 days and ended up finding the right man for the job through Behance. If he works out, then this was $200 well spent.
