I’ve been able to get a bunch done in the last month and I’m getting closer and closer to my short-term goal of having a playable first 4 levels. This update includes new character animations, new attack icons, an updated character select screen, intro movie updates, and pinch/zoom functionality.

#### Character Updates

I’d like to introduce you to two new characters that are fully animated and now in the game. The first is the barbarian warrior, a giant of a man who hails from the northland and loves to dish out damage.

And in the right corner we have the halfman, a creature controlled by evil wizardry who cares for nothing other than death and destruction.

</div>

There were also some cosmetic fixes and new attack animations added to the previous characters that you’ve seen in-game.

#### More Attacks

Before this update a character could only perform a single base attack. Characters will all have multiple attack options and I’ve just added the ability for a character to perform those different attacks. As you can see in the demo below, the Guardian Knight’s various attack icons pop up after the initial attack icon is clicked. Let&#8217;s click on double attack and see what happens.

</div>

Right now I have things set up so that attacks only show when they’ve been unlocked in the [character selection screen][1]. I don’t yet know the details of how the attacks work, how much damage they do, etc., but I can experiment with all that now that the icons and animations are in there.

#### Intro Movie

[Brian Campbell][2] has been reworking the intro movie and it’s already looking a lot better than my original attempts.

Some great news on the video front is that I figured out a way to just play the .mov video in the game rather than programming the cut scenes. This is going to save me a ton of time, something I’m already short on.

#### Zoom

While testing the game on my iPad and iPhone I noticed that sometimes the screen felt a bit too small. On a whim I thought I’d quickly add the ability to tap to zoom and pinch/zoom. Little did I know that this would become a huge pain in the ass and that there was no type of functionality built into Corona. I’ll save you the details, but zoom functionality is now working after a few days of re-learning eighth grade math and banging my head against the wall.

#### Conclusion

This whole game thing is taking a lot longer than I’d expected, but I’m definitely continuing to make progress. I wish I could give better estimates as to how much more time it’s going to take before I have a playable version of the first 4 levels, but it seems there is always something else to add, test or debug. While I can’t make any promises to how long it’ll take, I can promise I’ll keep hammering away.
