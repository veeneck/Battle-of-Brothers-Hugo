desc1: Hey, I'm Ryan. I'm engaged to my wonderful fiance, Amanda. She keeps me responsible as I become a caveman when she's not around. I try to stay a young 31, but my grey hairs are quickly betraying me. Sports, activities, games, family and anything in front of a computer will generally keep me happy.
desc2: The first coding project I started on my own was a turn based game in C++. I remember crashing the computer once the hero had to walk more than 13 tiles. Pathing and genetic algorithms were a bit too much for me back in the day, so hopefully age and experience will see me through this time around. Regardless, there is nothing more exciting than being able to pursue a passion, so I'm loving this contest.
